# Command Center App

### Dependencies
You need to have `node.js` installed. Go [here](https://nodejs.org/download/) to get it if you don't have it already.

### Running Locally
- Run `npm install` to get all the node modules you need installed locally.
- Run `node run-server` to start the server. It should be running at `localhost:3000`.

### Adding Modules
- Run `npm install $PACKAGE_NAME --save`. The save flag adds the package to the `package.json` file. 
- Then stage and commit `package.json`.
